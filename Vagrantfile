  # other devices, a public network should be configured or port forwarding enabled.

  # Note: If your existing network is using the 192.168.50.x subnet, this default IP address
  # should be changed. If more than one VM is running through VirtualBox, including other
  # Vagrant machines, different subnets should be used for each.

  # Drive mapping

  # virtual machine to directories on your local machine. Once these are mapped, any
  # changes made to the files in these directories will affect both the local and virtual
  # machine versions. Think of it as two different ways to access the same file. When the
  # virtual machine is destroyed with `vagrant destroy`, your files will remain in your local
  # environment.

  # /srv/database/
  #
  # If a database directory exists in the same directory as your Vagrantfile,
  # a mapped directory inside the VM will be created that contains these files.
  # This directory is used to maintain default database scripts as well as backed
  # up mysql dumps (SQL files) that are to be imported automatically on vagrant up

  # nginx as well as any pre-existing database files.

  # /srv/www/
  #
  # If a www directory exists in the same directory as your Vagrantfile, a mapped directory
