  # other devices, a public network should be configured or port forwarding enabled.

  # Note: If your existing network is using the 192.168.50.x subnet, this default IP address
  # should be changed. If more than one VM is running through VirtualBox, including other
  # Vagrant machines, different subnets should be used for each.

  # virtual machine to directories on your local machine. Once these are mapped, any

  # machine versions. Think of it as two different ways to access the same file. When the
  # virtual machine is destroyed with `vagrant destroy`, your files will remain in your local
  # environment.
